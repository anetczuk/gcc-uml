# gcc-lang-raw-parser

Parse gcc/g++ raw internal tree data.


## Running

[There](doc/cmdargs.md) is description of command line arguments.

To run application simply execute followoing command:
```
python3 -m gcclangrawparser.main --help
```


#### Obtaining data from *g++*

Parser as input needs intermediate data from *g++* compiler. Compilation have to be done using `-fdump-lang-raw` flag
informing compiler to print translation unit internal representation to file.
Passing the flag to `cmake` and obtaining internal representation can be done in following way:
```
    cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ \
          -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-fdump-lang-raw" \
          ...
    cmake --build .
```
Similarly, running `make` can be done like this:
```
    make CXX_FLAGS="-fdump-lang-raw"
```
Following command works for `Makefile`-s generated by `cmake` (it's impossible to change compiler without 
calling `cmake`). For custom made `Makefile`-s investigate the file (try *standarized* `CXX="g++"` and `CXXFLAGS="-fdump-lang-raw"`).


## Callgraph info

Other interesting *gcc* option is `-fcallgraph-info`. Using `graph-easy` from `libgraph-easy-perl` output can be converted 
to *dot* diagram.


## Installation

Installation of package can be done by:
 - to install package from downloaded ZIP file execute: `pip3 install --user -I file:gcc-lang-raw-parser-master.zip#subdirectory=src`
 - to install package directly from GitHub execute: `pip3 install --user -I git+https://github.com/anetczuk/gcc-lang-raw-parser.git#subdirectory=src`
 - uninstall: `pip3 uninstall gcclangrawparser`

Installation for development:
 - `install-deps.sh` to install package dependencies only (`requirements.txt`)
 - `install-package.sh` to install package in standard way through `pip` (with dependencies)
 - `install-devel.sh` to install package in developer mode using `pip` (with dependencies)


## Issues

- In case of multiple inheritance it is not possible to get accurate information about virtual inheritance
(tested under *g++* version 13.2.0). Sample code is in `examples/inheritgraph/src/inherit_virt.cpp` file.


## Development

All tests, linters and content generators can be executed by simple script `./process-all.sh`.

Unit tests are executed by `./src/testgcclangrawparser/runtests.py`.

Code linters can be run by `./tools/checkall.sh`.
