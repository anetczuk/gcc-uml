# gcc-uml

Generate varius outputs based on gcc internal tree data. Program, among others, produces following artifacts:
- [inheritance diagram](#inheritgraph),
- [memory layout diagram](#memlayout),
- [activity diagram](#ctrlflowgraph),
- [HTML version of compiler internal tree](#printhtml) (more human-friendly).

To generate include graph using gcc or clang use project 
[cpp-include-graph](https://github.com/anetczuk/cpp-include-graph).

Project is inspired by *clang-uml* tool.

*Note*: this is early stage of the project, so many things can change.


## Tools

Application consists of following tools:

### memlayout

*memlayout* generates memory layout of structures.

Following example presents diamond inheritance and template use:

[![memlayout tool example](doc/samples/mem_sample.cpp.svg "memlayout tool example")](doc/samples/mem_sample.cpp.svg)

### inheritgraph

With *inheritgraph* it is possible to generate inheritance diagram. It look like class diagram, but limited to 
inheritance relationship.

Example presents inheritance graph with diamond and template example:

[![inheritgraph tool example](doc/samples/inherit_sample.cpp.svg "inheritgraph tool example")](doc/samples/inherit_sample.cpp.svg)

### ctrlflowgraph

*ctrlflowgraph* generates UML activity diagram.

*Note*: currently *ctrlflowgraph* tool handles very small subset of *gcc* tree tokens.

Example consists of switch and method call.

[![ctrlflowgraph tool example](doc/samples/ctrl_sample.cpp.puml.svg "ctrlflowgraph tool example")](doc/samples/ctrl_sample.cpp.puml.svg)

### printhtml

*printhtml* tool prints *g++* internal tree in form of HTML pages. By default this form is slightly transformed:

- *chain* elements are convert to list of attributes,
- *tree_list* and *chan* elements are converted to list.

Transformations can be disabled through command line argument.

All expanded elements (by default) can be collapsed.

Example presents structure of *type_def* element:

## Running

Use of application requires two steps:

1. obtaining internal tree data from *g++*,
2. executing the tool.


#### Obtaining data from *g++*

*gcc-uml* as input needs intermediate data from *g++* compiler. Compilation have to be done using `-fdump-lang-raw` flag
informing compiler to print translation unit internal representation to file.
Passing the flag to `cmake` and obtaining internal representation can be done in following way:
```
    cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ \
          -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-fdump-lang-raw" \
          ...
    cmake --build .
```
Similarly, running `make` can be done like this:
```
    make CXX_FLAGS="-fdump-lang-raw"
```
Following command works for `Makefile`-s generated by `cmake` (it's impossible to change compiler without 
calling `cmake`). For custom made `Makefile`-s investigate the file (try *standarized* `CXX="g++"` and `CXXFLAGS="-fdump-lang-raw"`).


#### Running the application

To run application simply execute followoing command:
```
python3 -m gccuml.main --help
```

Application provides limited support for *clang-uml* configuration files. Before use the config file have to be changed 
in following ways:
- supported diagram types: `inheritgraph`,`memlayout`,`ctrlflowgraph`,
- input / glob file paths have to contain `.003l.raw` extension instead of `.h`, `.cpp` or similar,
- relative paths have to be changed from source to build directory (there are stored `.003l.raw` files).

Application accepts following arguments:

## Installation

Installation of package can be done by:
 - to install package from downloaded ZIP file execute: `pip3 install --user -I file:gcc-uml-master.zip#subdirectory=src`
 - to install package directly from GitHub execute: `pip3 install --user -I git+https://github.com/anetczuk/gcc-uml.git#subdirectory=src`
 - uninstall: `pip3 uninstall gccuml`

Installation for development:
 - `install-deps.sh` to install package dependencies only (`requirements.txt`)
 - `install-package.sh` to install package in standard way through `pip` (with dependencies)
 - `install-devel.sh` to install package in developer mode using `pip` (with dependencies)


## Limitations

- pre `gcc-15` versions have bug that does not allow to detect call to virtual method
- in case of bitfields there is no information about bitfield type


## Callgraph info

Other interesting *gcc* option is `-fcallgraph-info`. `graph-easy` from `libgraph-easy-perl` can convert callgraph 
output to *dot* diagram.


## Development

All tests, linters and content generators can be executed by simple script `./process-all.sh`.

Unit tests are executed by `./src/testgccuml/runtests.py`.

Code linters can be run by `./tools/checkall.sh`.

In case of pull requests please run `process-all.sh` before the request.

#### Validation

In `validate` directory are two scripts `run-local-sources.sh` and `run-gcc-tests.sh`. They serve to run 
tools against various sources. In first case sources are taken from `examples` and in the other case 
sources are taken from `testsuite` in gcc source code (the source code is downloaded if needed).

The purpose of the scripts is to check tools agains runtime errors. It is very usefull in case of `ctrlflowgraph` 
to find unhandled lang tree elements.
